Welcome to help I'm here for You ,Love 
Overview:
The goal of the game is to select two cards that add up to 13.
This clears the cards and unviels cards behind them that are blocked
For example you can add 10 and 3 , 7 and 6....
Jacks are 11, Queens is 12 and Kings are 13..
If you have no options you can click on the foward arrow and scoll trough the cards in the pile at the bottom
You can also select cards in the pile
You can always scroll back 
Strategy:
USE LOGIC.
Try clearing the cards that unviels the most card
Do not waste cards in the pile by clearing two cards in the pile at the same time
This limits your future moves.. Trust me
